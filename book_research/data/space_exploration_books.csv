The Time Machine,H. G. Wells,/works/OL52267W,"The Time Traveller, a dreamer obsessed with traveling through time, builds himself a time machine and, much to his surprise, travels over 800,000 years into the future. He lands in the year 802701: the world has been transformed by a society living in apparent harmony and bliss, but as the Traveler stays in the future he discovers a hidden barbaric and depraved subterranean class. Wells's transparent commentary on the capitalist society was an instant bestseller and launched the time-travel genre.","Self-experimentation in medicine in fiction; Fiction; Time travel in fiction; Dystopias in fiction; Literature; Scientists; Classic Literature; Open Library Staff Picks; Scientists in fiction; Space warfare; Self-experimentation in medicine; open_syllabus_project; English Science fiction; Dystopias; Time travel; Science fiction; Animal experimentation in fiction; Juvenile fiction; Comic and Graphic Books; Animal experimentation; Space warfare in fiction; Graphic novels; Comics & Graphic Novels; General; FICTION / Classics; Movie novels; FICTION / Science Fiction / Time Travel; Science fiction time travel; Children's fiction; Time travel, fiction; British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author); Fiction, science fiction, general; Fiction, dystopian; Fiction, action & adventure; Literature and fiction, science fiction; Cartoons and comics; Space and time, fiction; Short stories; English fiction; Texts; Easy reading materials; Space and time; Child and youth fiction; Comics & graphic novels, science fiction; Comics & graphic novels, literary; English literature; Coloring books; Color, juvenile literature; Adaptations; Comic books, strips; Inventors; Imaginary wars and battles; Science-fiction; Romans; Voyages dans le temps; Romans, nouvelles, etc. pour la jeunesse; Fiction, historical, general; Dictionaries; English language; Spanish; German; French; Korean; Time machine (Wells, H.
