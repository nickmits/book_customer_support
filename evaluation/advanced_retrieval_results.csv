The rush of chaotic violence strained\nagainst her resolve. Fane shifted his weight nervously on her shoulder. Teeth grinding, Malaki said, “Who did you promise, Isolde?”\nSwallowing back the malice, Isolde replied, “A mother of one of the\nchildren they found dead.” She had seen sorrow before, but not such\nwretched despair. It was as if the woman wished for nothing more than to\nslip into oblivion. As if she never existed. With the dead child still clutched\nto her chest, she begged Isolde, disguised as the Hood, to help those who\nremained at Foxclove. “Taking the humans was not part of the plan,” said Malaki.', 'Chapter 26\n27. Chapter 27\nAcknowledgments\nAbout the Author', '“W\nChapter 1\nell, that’s unfortunate,” Isolde Cotheran said, as she buried the\nblade into the hollow of the guard’s neck. “We could have been\nfriends.”\nThe blade slid free as he fell to the forest floor, his eyes wide as if in\nsurprise. Garbled words faded away as they escaped his now ruby-red lips. A pool of blood trickled into the dark tunic and dead leaves scattered about. The usual, rejected thoughts invaded Isolde’s mind. Who was he?', 'Did you have to kill him? Shaking herself free, Isolde wiped the blade on the guard’s pant leg and\npushed it back into the scabbard at her hip. Killing wasn’t something she\nenjoyed. Still, she couldn’t risk the guard running back to his platoon and\nraising the alarm. Without a second glance, she hooked a gloved hand over\na branch and began to climb. Moron. All he had to do was tell me the count of guards on duty tonight. Isolde shook her head. Hope you thought it was worth your life. Although\nshe wasn’t quite sure even that would have saved him. She stopped halfway up the massive oak, her steps sure and relaxed as\nshe strolled along a wide branch. The presence of the others hiding amongst\nthe leaves pressed against her skin like a warm assurance. Cries of agony\nstreaming from Foxclove had long since ceased. The many tortured voices\nwere now silent in the dead of night. “You’re quiet. Which is highly unlike you.”', 'From the forest below, a chorus of vulgarity filtered through the\nbranches, followed by a growl and the scurrying of feet. “They might\nactually kill each other,” Blyana said, after a moment. Isolde sighed, a grin tugging at her lips, “Well, it’s not like the place is\ncrawling with guards to see them anyway.”\nOnly a handful of uniform-clad guards [KW12]\xa0patrolled the upper lip\nof the stone wall near the dungeons. One to the east and the other surveying\nthe western border. A thankful smile played on Isolde’s lips. At least that\npart of the plan had been accurate. “Imbeciles,” Blyana mumbled, tucking in a strand of blonde hair and\nsecuring the hood around her face and head. “Dagan has become far more\nlenient in his security since his father’s untimely passing. It’s almost\nunfair.”\nAs nimble as the cat lurking within, Blyana leapt down onto a branch\nbeside Isolde. The dark purple of her hood twinkled faintly. A sea of stars\ndanced on her head as she stepped out into the open air. “He’ll regret that decision.” Each word sounded odd, distorted as it\nspilled through Isolde’s mask. A bow and quiver were draped across her back along with a pair of\nsilver-handled swords adorned with intricate carvings of mountain peaks on\none and roaring waves on the other. Small, intricate rivers of metal ran\nalong the broad side of the blades.', 'Isolde slid her gaze to the shadow lurking on the branch next to her as\nFane descended from the canopy. The hawk, now resting on her shoulder,\nadjusted his footing. The sharp talons burrowed into the leather of her worn,\nblack cloak. “I just killed a man, Malaki. Do you expect me to be chatty?” she asked,\nturning her gaze forward once more, away from her second-in-command. “Besides, I figured you would enjoy the silence.”\n“For you, silence is never a good thing.” Malaki paused, hazel eyes\ngazing out into the dark. His colossal shoulders rolled, the leather strap\nkeeping the sharp, double-edged axe in place strained. “Especially not\ntonight.”\n“Why, because a lot of men might die?” Isolde asked, her eyebrow\ncocking. “By my hand?', 'Not this time. Only one particular question had yet to be\nanswered. “Do I let the bastard live?” she muttered, crossing her arms. Tiny puffs\nof breath leaked through the mesh cloth pulled tightly over the lower half of\nher face. A face that had not aged in thirty-five years. Since her twentieth\nbirthday. Her sun-kissed skin had yet to hold a single wrinkle. Much to\nIsolde’s vain satisfaction. Water slid down the black hood meant to hide her\nfrom the world onto the quiet forest below, which was now soaked in blood. A familiar sigh ghosted from the shadows. His husky voice stirred her\nhumanity, the one part of herself she wished to bury, at least for tonight. “It’s a choice you can’t take back,” said Malaki. Her beacon of light in the\nstorm of uncertainty. “Obviously,” she said. Her emerald eyes, laced with ribbons of silver,\nrolled in annoyance. “You are the one who asked.”\nHer narrowed gaze, ignited by the power stirring beneath her skin, slid\nto where he lumbered. “Rhetorical questions do not demand obvious,\nobnoxious answers, Malaki.” Irritation blossomed as a whisper of a chuckle\nfiltered through the downpour between them. “With you, there is no such thing as a rhetorical question, Isolde. Especially when the decision of ending a life is on the table.”', '“And in small groups,” Isolde added. “Few are easier to hide if\nnecessary.”\nMalaki sighed heavily and turned his attention back to the manor. She\ncould practically see his mind wrapping around the series of new problems\nthat could and would meet them head-on. Foxclove, while the smallest of the seven territories in Arnoria,\nstretched out in all directions. It had been the desire of Lord Theort, the\nprevious ruler of Foxclove, to see from all angles. “Nowhere for the enemy\nto sneak up on me,” he had said to her, playfully tugging at her dark brown\ncurls when she was a child. Of course, he had been anticipating an army…\nnot a small cadre of thieves and assassins. Now, row after row of dirty metal barracks wrapped around the\nperimeter in tight, uniform rings. Replacing the once lush fields Isolde\nplayed in as a girl. Like a giant, glistening serpent, the Lenda River stood between them\nand the first row of barracks. It served as the main means of transportation\nfor the coveted goods of many territories.', 'The only sound was the steady rhythm of\nthe rain. Isolde knew this was coming. Changing the plan, especially now…\nIt would be a problem; she had known it would be. [KW3]\xa0Apprehension\nprickled at the back of her neck as the heavy silence continued. They had gone over the plan countless times. Picking apart Foxclove\nlike it was a roasted chicken until nothing was left. They knew every angle,\nevery possibility of failure until Malaki was satisfied and on board. Still,\nshe had known springing this change on him wasn’t going to be pleasant\neither way. “Answer me,”\xa0Malaki growled. “There’s been a slight change of plans,” Isolde said, the words forcing\ntheir way around the ball of apprehension stuck in her throat. Malaki’s head whipped around. “We don’t have changes in plans,\nIsolde.”\n“Well,” Cillian said, as he dusted a piece of bark from the dark green,\nleather coat hugging his chest, “tonight we do.”\n“What changes?” Malaki asked. Tension rolled off him in palpable,\nblazing waves. “The gold is not the only thing leaving with us tonight,” said Isolde.']","['Thief of Sorrows © 2023 by Kristen M. Long\nMap © 2023 by Kristen M.

The context reveals that Arnoria is divided into seven territories, with Foxclove being the smallest yet strategically significant. The previous ruler, Lord Theort, had a vision of comprehensive oversight, believing that a well-structured territory would prevent surprise attacks. This reflects a broader military strategy where visibility and control over the landscape are paramount for defense against potential threats.

The current situation in Foxclove, however, highlights a shift in governance and security. The new ruler, Dagan, has become lax in his security measures, which Isolde and her companions note with concern. This change in leadership and the subsequent decline in security create vulnerabilities that can be exploited by those who oppose Dagan, such as Isolde and her group of thieves and assassins. The mention of the Lenda River as a vital transportation route for goods further emphasizes the importance of controlling key geographical features in territorial strategy.

Moreover, the moral implications of decision-making in Arnoria are underscored by the characters' discussions about the treatment of slaves and the urgency of their mission. Isolde's internal conflict about the risks involved in their plans reflects the weight of ethical considerations in strategic decisions. The urgency to act against the injustices faced by the oppressed in Foxclove illustrates how the dynamics of power and morality intersect in the realm of territorial strategy.

In summary, Arnoria's significance lies in its representation of the complexities of territorial control, the consequences of leadership decisions, and the ethical dilemmas faced by those navigating the power structures within its borders. The characters' actions and motivations are deeply intertwined with the fate of the territories, showcasing how strategy and morality are inextricably linked in their quest for justice.","Arnoria is a crucial area depicted on the map, serving as a focal point for strategic territorial considerations.

Isolde's character is marked by a blend of ruthlessness and compassion, as she navigates the complexities of her mission while grappling with the moral implications of her actions.","Isolde Cotheran is a character who, in a tense moment, expresses regret about a potential friendship while committing an act of violence, as she kills a guard in a forest setting.",1.0,1.0,0.5381944444309895,0.9716472350578137,0.11

Anger, revenge, and bloodlust.', 'From the forest below, a chorus of vulgarity filtered through the\nbranches, followed by a growl and the scurrying of feet. “They might\nactually kill each other,” Blyana said, after a moment.

It’s almost\nunfair.”\nAs nimble as the cat lurking within, Blyana leapt down onto a branch\nbeside Isolde. The dark purple of her hood twinkled faintly. A sea of stars\ndanced on her head as she stepped out into the open air. “He’ll regret that decision.” Each word sounded odd, distorted as it\nspilled through Isolde’s mask. A bow and quiver were draped across her back along with a pair of\nsilver-handled swords adorned with intricate carvings of mountain peaks on\none and roaring waves on the other. Small, intricate rivers of metal ran\nalong the broad side of the blades.', 'They held a faint, green sheen. A sight\nthat made her blood run cold. Isolde had always thought the blades looking\nlike living metal. A monstrous creation meant to destroy her kind. Various\nblades were hidden along the linings of her clothes. These too held the same\neerie glow. They were the many tools she used to shelve out vengeance. Confidently, she strode to the edge of the limb and extended her hand.

Must not have made a\nbig impression.” A small air of amusement ghosted on the edges of his\nvoice. “Losing your touch are you, Hood?”\nIsolde growled, the sound mingling with the light chuckle from Blyana. Fane chirped in irritation, his beak nibbling at her mask. “My warning had\nthe same sting as it always does.” Her instructions were easy enough:\nchange the treatment of humans and half-bloods, or die. Dagan had clearly squandered that warning. Not a hint of change could\nbe seen; if anything,…things were far worse. “It would appear Dagan likes\nto play games. Even ones that involve the abrupt end to his life.”\nAlong the ridge of the wall, guards walked the perimeter.

Fane shifted his weight nervously on her shoulder. Teeth grinding, Malaki said, “Who did you promise, Isolde?”\nSwallowing back the malice, Isolde replied, “A mother of one of the\nchildren they found dead.” She had seen sorrow before, but not such\nwretched despair. It was as if the woman wished for nothing more than to\nslip into oblivion. As if she never existed. With the dead child still clutched\nto her chest, she begged Isolde, disguised as the Hood, to help those who\nremained at Foxclove. “Taking the humans was not part of the plan,” said Malaki.', 'Isolde slid her gaze to the shadow lurking on the branch next to her as\nFane descended from the canopy.

Her emerald eyes, laced with ribbons of silver,\nrolled in annoyance. “You are the one who asked.”\nHer narrowed gaze, ignited by the power stirring beneath her skin, slid\nto where he lumbered. “Rhetorical questions do not demand obvious,\nobnoxious answers, Malaki.” Irritation blossomed as a whisper of a chuckle\nfiltered through the downpour between them. “With you, there is no such thing as a rhetorical question, Isolde. Especially when the decision of ending a life is on the table.”', '“I’m aware of that,” she bit back. “There’s a small group in the\ndungeons just to the east, closest to the river. My point of contact told me\nthey were in the worst condition. The ones that probably wouldn’t make it\nmuch longer.”\n“The ones that will be the most trouble to get out you mean,” said\nMalaki. The words hung in the air between them. “The ones that need our help the most.” Her voice was hollow, as if she\ncouldn’t believe what he was saying. He took a deep breath, his eyes squeezing shut. “I assume there’s more\nthan one boat lurking about downstream.”\n“You even asking is an insult,” Cillian muttered. His fingers toyed with\nthe blades at his side. Isolde looked up to Blyana, who stared down, her cat-\nlike eyes reflecting in the dark.

You’re the vain one, not me.”\n“I’m not vain, am I Fane?” Isolde cooed, her fingertips scratching his\nchin. The hawk chirped happily, his eyes closing against her touch.', 'Arrows nestled in the quivers\non their backs.

Blyana’s\ntiny chest rumbled, her eyes igniting as the monster just beneath the surface\nprowled. “Easy,” Isolde said, her own instincts flaring. “It would be ill-advised\nfor you to transform so soon.” She knew Blyana’s limits, what triggered her\npower to come forward and seize control. Anger, revenge, and bloodlust.', 'An adversary,\ncreated in childhood, that had never been defeated. His obsidian gaze swept up to Blyana where she perched on the limb\nabove. Worry shined in his eyes as they ran over the open air beneath her. Isolde fought the urge to roll her eyes at his fussing. It was an\nunnecessary worry. Isolde knew Blyana’s abilities and heights were more of\nan asset to her, than a hindrance. “Enough, Cill,” Isolde said, the hint of a smile coating her words. “I\ndon’t need my cover blown with Malaki beating your ass senseless before\nthe mission even starts.” Cillian merely nodded, his face fighting a grin as\nhis muscles relaxed a fraction. She felt Malaki’s irritated gaze fall to her,\nbut he kept his tongue in check. “Children,” Blyana murmured as she stretched out on the limb, an arm\nand leg dangling. “You all remember your positions?” Malaki asked, ignoring her\ncompletely. A beat of silence followed.', 'Did he have a family? What was his name? And the worst one of all.', 'Isolde slid her gaze to the shadow lurking on the branch next to her as\nFane descended from the canopy. The hawk, now resting on her shoulder,\nadjusted his footing. The sharp talons burrowed into the leather of her worn,\nblack cloak. “I just killed a man, Malaki. Do you expect me to be chatty?” she asked,\nturning her gaze forward once more, away from her second-in-command. “Besides, I figured you would enjoy the silence.”\n“For you, silence is never a good thing.” Malaki paused, hazel eyes\ngazing out into the dark. His colossal shoulders rolled, the leather strap\nkeeping the sharp, double-edged axe in place strained. “Especially not\ntonight.”\n“Why, because a lot of men might die?” Isolde asked, her eyebrow\ncocking. “By my hand?', 'He kept a steady hand on the trunk of the tree. “Too much\nexcitement will undoubtedly send the old man to an early grave.”\nA sharp snarl pierced the small space, causing Fane to bat his wings in\nagitation. A faint light shined in Malaki’s gaze as his eyes narrowed. “You’ll think old, Cillian, when I throw you from this tree.”\n“Don’t overexert yourself now. I hear that’s ill-advised in the elderly.”\nCillian’s voice was filled with humor but Isolde knew better. While he possessed an air of ease, Isolde could see the stiffness that ran\nalong Cillian’s defined arms and the strain at the corners of his dark eyes.', 'From the forest below, a chorus of vulgarity filtered through the\nbranches, followed by a growl and the scurrying of feet. “They might\nactually kill each other,” Blyana said, after a moment. Isolde sighed, a grin tugging at her lips, “Well, it’s not like the place is\ncrawling with guards to see them anyway.”\nOnly a handful of uniform-clad guards [KW12]\xa0patrolled the upper lip\nof the stone wall near the dungeons. One to the east and the other surveying\nthe western border. A thankful smile played on Isolde’s lips.
