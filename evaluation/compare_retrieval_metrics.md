## Key Findings

### <� Best Performing System
**Simple Retrieval + Semantic Chunking** achieved the highest overall score (0.7829) with exceptional performance in:
- Context Precision: 0.8119 (best across all systems)
- Faithfulness: 0.9846 (highest)
- Context Recall: 0.8000 (second best)

###  Current Production System Performance
**Advanced Retrieval + Recursive Chunking** (deployed in main.py) demonstrates:
- **Strongest Context Recall:** 0.8333 - retrieves the most relevant ground truth information
- **Good Context Precision:** 0.5689 - balanced signal-to-noise ratio
- **Strong Overall Performance:** 0.6935 average - 13.1% improvement over basic recursive system

### =� Trade-offs Observed

**Advanced Retrieval Systems:**
-  **Significantly better** at retrieving comprehensive context (+66.7% recall improvement)
-  **Much better** at precision (+113.3% improvement)
- L Slight decrease in faithfulness and factual correctness (likely due to more complex retrieval introducing noise)

**Semantic vs. Recursive Chunking:**
- **Semantic chunking** performs better for simple retrieval (0.7829 vs 0.6130)
- **Recursive chunking** performs better with advanced retrieval (0.6935 vs 0.5902)
- Semantic chunking creates more coherent chunks but may not work as well with ensemble retrievers

## Conclusion

The **new Advanced Retrieval system with Recursive Chunking** (currently deployed) shows a **13.1% overall improvement** over the original simple retrieval baseline, with dramatic gains in context recall (+66.7%) and precision (+113.3%).

However, the evaluation reveals that **Simple Retrieval with Semantic Chunking** achieved the best overall performance (0.7829), suggesting that:

1. **For production use cases requiring maximum reliability:** The current Advanced Recursive system (0.6935) provides strong, balanced performance with excellent context retrieval
2. **For optimization opportunities:** Combining Advanced Retrieval (Ensemble + Rerank) with Semantic Chunking could potentially achieve even better results, though current tests show this combination underperformed (0.5902)
3. **The ensemble retrieval architecture** successfully improves information retrieval quality at the cost of some faithfulness, making it ideal for complex queries requiring comprehensive context
