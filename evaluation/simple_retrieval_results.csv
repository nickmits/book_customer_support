He is portrayed as someone deeply loved by Isolde, and his tragic death has profoundly impacted her life. The context reveals that Kamden was taken from Isolde by a character named Gage, which has led to Isolde's intense feelings of grief, anger, and a desire for revenge. 

Isolde reflects on the life she could have had with Kamden, lamenting the ""forty years"" they could have shared together, indicating that his loss has left a void in her life that no one else can fill. His memory haunts her, as she recalls his laughter and smile, and she is unable to escape the pain associated with his death. The narrative suggests that Kamden's death is a pivotal event that drives Isolde's motivations throughout the story, particularly her vow to seek vengeance against Gage for stealing her future and happiness. Thus, Kamden's role is central to Isolde's emotional journey and the overarching themes of loss and revenge in the story.","Kamden is the heart and soul of this story, and the narrative emphasizes that they are not forgotten.",1.0,0.9375,0.0
