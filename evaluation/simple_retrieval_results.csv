Rows of newly constructed barracks\nsurrounded Foxclove manor. A handful of guards patrolled the muddy\ngrounds snaking between the buildings. Light danced off the swords that\nhung at their sides and tips of the spears clutched in their grasp. Fane, perched on her shoulder, nuzzled closer, nipping at the edges of\nher mask. He was white as snow, save for the spots of red that decorated the\ntips of his feathers that were tucked tightly into his sides. Stretching out the\nedge of the hood, Isolde created a small crevice for him to burrow into. “Yet here we are,” a light, sensual voice purred from above. Drops of\nwater cascaded over the leather hoods drawn tightly around Isolde and\nMalaki’s faces as the lethal creature stretched precariously. Her dark purple\nhood and cloak groaned in protest. “You speak as if we have a choice in this situation, Blyana.” Isolde’s\neyes shot up in annoyance as she ran a gloved finger down the bridge of\nFane’s beak. “I’m not trying to change your mind,” Blyana said, a sly smile creeping\ninto her voice.', 'D\nChapter 2\neath filled Malaki’s nose as he and Cillian raced through the rows of\nsilent barracks.

Blyana’s forefinger scrubbed against her left thumb. The rough, jagged\nscrapes, Isolde knew, were a nervous tick. A small tattoo of a serpent was\netched into the skin, just below the first knuckle of Blyana’s thumb. It was\nsymbol, a brand that had marked her as property once upon a time.
